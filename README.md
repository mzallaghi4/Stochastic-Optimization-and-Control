## Stochastic Optimization and Control & Reinforcement Learning  

Stochastic control is a mathematical framework used to make optimal decisions in systems influenced by random noise.

### Objective
The goal is to implement, analyze, and compare various stochastic control techniquesâ€”from classical methods to modern machine learning approachesâ€”with applications to real-world problems in portfolio optimization, risk management, option pricing, dynamic asset allocation, and algorithmic trading.

The project addresses both classical and modern techniques in stochastic control, including: 
â€¢	â€¢ Convex optimization in stochastic environments 
â€¢	â€¢ Discrete-time stochastic control 
â€¢	â€¢ Continuous-time stochastic control 
â€¢	â€¢ Reinforcement learning methods

**Quantitative Finance Applications:** 
Portfolio optimization, algorithmic trading strategies, asset allocation, and risk control.

We implement and analyze practical problems in quantitative finance, such as portfolio optimization.

The primary focus is on applying advanced topics in portfolio management, including;
- Reinforcement learning approaches 
- Mean-field theory



#### Reinforcement Learning:
Training agents to learn optimal policies for trading, portfolio management, and risk mitigation through interaction with financial environments.

## Reinforcement Learning for Quantitative Trading

This project includes a reinforcement learning framework for developing and evaluating trading strategies in financial markets.
