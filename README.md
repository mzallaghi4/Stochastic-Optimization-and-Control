#  Stochastic Optimization and Control 

Stochastic control is a mathematical framework used to make optimal decisions in systems influenced by random noise.

### Objective
The goal is to implement, analyze, and compare various stochastic control techniques—from classical methods to modern machine learning approaches—with applications to real-world problems in portfolio optimization, risk management, option pricing, dynamic asset allocation, and algorithmic trading.

The project addresses both classical and modern techniques in stochastic control, including: 
•	• Convex optimization in stochastic environments 
•	• Discrete-time stochastic control 
•	• Continuous-time stochastic control 
•	• Reinforcement learning methods for control

We implement and analyze practical problems in quantitative finance, such as portfolio optimization.

The primary focus is on applying advanced topics in portfolio management, including;
- Reinforcement learning approaches 
- Mean-field theory
