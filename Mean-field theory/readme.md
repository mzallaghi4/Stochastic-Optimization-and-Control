## Mean Field Game & Mean Field Control problems

Mean Field Game (MFG) and Mean Field Control (MFC) are mathematical frameworks developed to analyze decision-making in very large populations of interacting agents.

#### Field Control (MFC)

Mean Field Control deals with a single decision-maker (central planner or representative agent) who controls a large population.

The agentâ€™s decisions depend not only on their own state but also on the statistical distribution (mean field) of the entire population.
